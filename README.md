# Health_score
This project  shows individualâ€™s age, BMI, exercise frequency, diet quality, sleep hours, smoking status, alcohol consumption, and health score.
Questions:
1.	Visualize the distributions of each variable and provide their summary statistics
2.	Now, test the assumption that all predictor variables are independent using correlation coefficients or test of associations. Visualize your results using scatter plots and a correlation matrix.
3.	Using linear regression modelling, describe the variables which you believe have an influence on charge and describe your model with coefficients. Note, you may consider other models beyond the taught material which may be more appropriate for modelling the outcome variable.
